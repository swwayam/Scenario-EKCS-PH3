---- Why we need TS ?
   - Improve dev experience.
   - Easy to debug
   - More descriptive than JS. ex - we know the datatypes which overall improves redaiblity.
   - Is to maintain
   - To much to write compared to JS.

---- Datatyes in TS / JS 
   - number -> example : 11, 12 , -12312, 12341314 , 0
   - string -> example : "EKCS" , 'EKCS', `EKCS` (this is called template literal)
   - boolean -> example : true , false
   - void -> Void is a return type, (Means it is used on function to denote that the fucntion won't return any value )
   - any -> You can use this to automatically detect the type of a data.


---- Functions, parameter and Return type
   - void 
   - any
   - other general datatype

--- Angular Structure
    -- All the angular code is written inside app folder
    -- Components -> Small piece of code that can be reused by other component 
    -- Functions and Events

    **** Counter App ****

--- Improving Counter App
    -- We changed the counter app to an cart app
    -- We added logic to notify user about the cart status

--- Angular Derectives 
    -- @if(){} -> We used it to implement logic into our html file

--- Basic Events
    -- (click)
    -- Basic ecomm cart functionality

*************************************************************

--- Angular Form
    -- Taking input form user using the traditional method (#variableName)
    -- How to do basic validation -> we take only the right data ( Handeling Edge Cases )
    -- Displaying Data to HTML ( Data Binding )

    **** Form Hw ****

--- Create a form which takes two inputs.
    -- First input username.
    -- second input of password.
    -- when user clicks on submit button log the username and password to console.

    -- Optional -> Edge Case Handeling
        - Username should only contain alphabets.
        - Pasword lenght must be greater than or equal 6
        - You should also have a show password
